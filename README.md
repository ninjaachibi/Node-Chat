# Node Chat

A fun terminal-based chat app using Node.js and Socket.io.

## Usage 

1. Clone this repo, `cd` into it, and run `npm i`
2. In one terminal window, run `npm run server`
3. In another window(s), run `npm run client <username>`. If you want to specify your own username, otherwise, the server will assign you a guest username.
4. Chat away! And have fun!

Note since the server is localhost on this project, it only works locally. If you want, you could use a `ngrok` server to make this game playable across different networks.
