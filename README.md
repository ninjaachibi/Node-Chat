3. In another window(s), run `npm run client <username>`. If you want to specify your own username, otherwise, the server will assign you a guest username.

4. Chat away! And have fun! 🥳

Note: since the server is `localhost` on this project, it only works locally. If you want, you could use a `ngrok` server to make this game playable across different networks.
